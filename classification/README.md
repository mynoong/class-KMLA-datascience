# What is Classification?
The task of categorizing or assigning input data points to predefined classes or categories. The goal of classification is to build models that can accurately predict the class of new, unseen data based on patterns and features learned from a labeled dataset.

## Description
The program undertakes the classification of insect sexes, dividing them into two distinct categories: male and female. By deriving the optimal logistic function, the boundary is established where the probability to be classified as male or female attains the threshold of 0.5. Furthermore, arbitrary dataset with 2 dimension, 2 classes are generated; the program searches the most optimal boundary lines and segments cases into two classes.

`dataGenerate.py` : generates insects' body length v. sex (0 = female, 1 = male) dataset and arbitrary 2 dimension 2 class dataset

`data_1d2c.npz` , `data_2d2c.npz` : datasets generated by `dataGenerate.py`

`classification.py` : the package includes classes and functions for finding optimized classification models
