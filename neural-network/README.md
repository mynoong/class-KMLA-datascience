# What is Neural Network?
A technique used to build models that can make predictions based on data. From given datasets, it grasps a pattern, establishes relationships between variables, and anticipates future outcomes.

## Description
These programs employ distinct regression algorithms to construct refined models using age versus height datasets. These algorithms examine the influence of age on height and generate regression lines to represent the correlation between these two variables. Furthermore, the dataset incorporates records of age, weight, and height; thus, An additional regression model is employed to establish the correlation between height and the combined influence of age and weight.

The methodologies include a fundamental linear model featuring numerical gradient descent optimization, a linear model integrated with an analytical solution, a linear model enhanced through Gaussian function, and a customized new model incorporating datasets trend.
